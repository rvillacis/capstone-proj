- Tableau database idea

- Anomaly detection on top of the data and model

- Maybe use ensemble models if the underlying models are uncorrelated

- Maybe do supervised learning showing the results of different dates and the result of the next

- Organize package into Models, Data, and Trading



Random trees:

remember to shift the results one day so that they can predict

Use returns and then also price, try to use different indicators

Use over/under or buy/sell rules for the indicators including MA(50)/MA(200) or RSI. Specially for random forests

Remember that they predict probability of the class so you can see how likely it is to be that class and then you can adjust probability

Remember to repeat and test with the same currency/time, different currencies, and different times  

Limit splits in some way

You always need to lag the return or result

Lagged vs current prices and returns
