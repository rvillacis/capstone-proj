# Capstone project with the CME Group: Dynamic ML Models for FX Portfolio Risk Management
## Andrew Villacis, Chloe Huang, Jiyuan Shi, Sahil Sachdev

As our capstone project for the M.S. in Analytics at the University of Chicago, our goal for this repository is to test and implement the use of 
different machine learning methods applied to a number of currency pairs for which we have daily data. We plan to create a suite of strategies
that in conjunction with one another can build a portfolio that will hopefully exceed benchmarks in risk/return parameters.

We will backtest every strategy we implement, as well as, the portfolio that will develop as a combination of multiple methods. Some of the
backtesting strategies we intend to use include a randomized time series start and beginning with a random portfolio.

Finally, we will take particular care of staying within risk/return parameters provided. The success of this portfolio will be measured by the
return we are able to accomplish per each unit of risk.

No short selling, no leverage, and no additional data will be allowed.
